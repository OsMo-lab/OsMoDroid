# suggestion: also ignore libs/*.properties files for old eclipse project
# can't be added here because multiple libs/ directory can be around in different paths
  
# Idea
# According to this
# see http://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/entries/23393067 and http://devnet.jetbrains.com/docs/DOC-1186
# I shouldn't ignore most of this stuff.. but looking at the content I see environment stuffs in it.
